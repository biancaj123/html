			<p><i> Australian athletes damaged beds in their Olympic village hotel rooms and put a hole in a wall before leaving, the country's Olympic committee says.</i></p>

			<p><q>But the Australian Olympic Committee said the national governing bodies of football and rugby union were investigating reports of rowdy behaviour on a flight into Sydney last Friday.</q></p>

<p>Chesterman said: "Some young people made a mistake - they had left the rooms in a condition that was unacceptable."
He added: "The rooms were not completely trashed in any way.

"It is a book as old as time: a good young person makes a mistake, chapter two is a good, young person is full of remorse.

"Chapter three is a good young person learns from the mistake and becomes a better person."<br>

Rugby Australia said it had launched its own investigation after being informed by Australian team officials of "unacceptable" behaviour by rugby and football players on the flight home from the Olympics.

"Rugby Australia has been made aware of incidents involving the Australian men's sevens programme after being informed by the Australian Olympic Committee," it said.<br>

Matt Carroll, chief executive of the Australian Olympic Committee, said there had been no formal complaint from the airline operating the flight, but added that "unacceptable behaviour was brought to our attention".

He said: "It's extremely disappointing, but both rugby and football [governing bodies] have told me that such behaviour is certainly not acceptable within their sports and have sincerely apologised to the Australian Olympic team.<br>

"The CEOs have undertaken to take the appropriate action and report back to us."

		Australia's men's rugby sevens team reached the quarter-finals at Tokyo 2020, losing to eventual winners Fiji.

		The men's footballers were eliminated from their tournament in the group stage. The women's footballers are not implicated as they are still at the Games - they face the United States in their bronze-medal match on Thursday.</p>	<br>

			<i>Hong Kong residents believe China is undermining its rights and freedoms</i>

			<p>Mr Biden said that because Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by China, the US would allow visitors to stay for a period of 18 months.Thousands of Hong Kong residents already in the US may benefit.China has reacted angrily to the announcement, describing the decision as a gross interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs.</p>

			<p>The UK has offered people from Hong Kong a path towards permanent residency following last year's adoption of China's security law for the territory.

			<p>Liu Pengyu, the spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, criticised the US government's actions, which he said "disregard and distort facts, and grossly interfere in China's internal affairs".

The Chinese foreign ministry's Hong Kong office said the US had engaged in a "plot to oppose China and stir up trouble in the city".

Maggie Shum, a researcher in the US, said many students had been left in limbo amid uncertainty about returning to Hong Kong and welcomed Thursday's news.<br>

"I feel elated and welcome this Biden decision to not abandon us - the US did not abandon us," she told Reuters news agency.

Samuel Chu of Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, which campaigned for the move, says the group estimates that it could affect some 100,000 people.

"It is a significant number because, I think, its a pretty good chance that a pretty large number of visitors would benefit from this," he told the BBC.

"Partly also because the situation in Hong Kong has been unfolding pretty publicly, and you've seen people travelling and leaving Hong Kong in droves, not just to the US but other countries."</p>

			<h2 id="news4"><u>Covid: WHO calls for booster pause to vaccinate poorer nations</u></h2>

			<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a suspension on booster vaccines for Covid-19 until at least the end of September.WHO Chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a pause would allow for at least 10% of the population in every country to be vaccinated.A number of nations including Israel and Germany have announced plans to administer a third dose.But Dr Tedros has warned poorer nations are falling behind.</p>

			<p>According to the WHO, low-income countries have only been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people due to a lack of supply. Dr Tedros said that there needs to be a reversal and that the majority of vaccines should go to lower income countries."I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it," he added. It is a strong call from the WHO, as the agency attempts to narrow the gap between high-income and low-income nations.</p>

			<p>It had wanted 10% of people in every country to be vaccinated by next month, but that target is unlikely to be met on the current trajectory.In Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, none of the population has received two doses of the vaccine. Indonesia, which has seen infections and deaths spike in recent months due to the Delta variant, has only fully vaccinated 7.9% of its population, according to Our World in Data.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile Israel began rolling out a booster shot for the over 60s, while Germany announced on Tuesday that it would start offering third doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. In the UK, millions of people classed as vulnerable could be offered a booster from September.<br>

			The US has not announced a policy on booster vaccinations but the White House said on Wednesday that it has enough doses to distribute vaccines abroad while also ensuring Americans can be fully vaccinated.

			"We definitely feel like it's a false choice and we can do both," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. <br>This is not the first time that Dr Tedros has called on richer nations to donate vaccine supplies to low-income countries.</p><br>
